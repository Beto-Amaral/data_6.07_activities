# 6.07 Activity 3

In this activity, you will understand the difference between absolute referencing and relative referencing through a simple example. Create a new Excel workbook for this activity

- Absolute referencing: Make sure that `Use relative reference` is turned off. Click on `Record Macro` and give the macro the name`month_absolute`. Move to cell A1 and enter the names of Months in the first row. Stop recording the macro.
- Relative referencing: This time ensure that `Use relative reference` is turned on. On a new sheet, move to cell A1. Click on `Record Macro` and give the macro the name`month_relative`. Enter the names of Months in the first row. Stop recording the macro.
- Now run the macros on different sheet and observe the differences in the two.
