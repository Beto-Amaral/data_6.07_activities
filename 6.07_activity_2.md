# 6.07 Activity 2

In this activity, you will use the `files_for_activities/lesson1_file1.xlsm` file.

- Pick any one macro and click on edit macro to move to the visual basic editor window. We used the `step into` method in the editor to execute the macro line by line and see how each line in VBA code changes the Excel sheet. Observe the changes in the Excel sheet and remove the lines in the VBA code that are not modifying the Excel.
